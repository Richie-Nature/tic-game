/** THERE ARE TWO PLAYERS
     * THE VALUE OF PLAYER ONE IS  'X'
     * THE VALUE OF PLAYER TWO IS  'O'
     * THERE'S A GLOBAL VARIABLE WITH ' 'AS ITS DEFAULT VALUE;
     * IF PLAYER ONE IS CALLED VALUE CHANGES TO THAT OF PLAYER ONE
     * IF PLAYER TWO IS CALLED VALUE CHANGES TO THAT OF PLAYER TWO
     * SET THAT CELL TO UNEDITABLE
     * IF A CELL IS CLICKED CALL PLAYER  AND DISPLAY PLAYER'S VALUE WHICH IS 'X' OR 'O'
     * SET THAT CELL TO UNEDITABLE
     * CALL FUNCTION CHECKWIN TO CHECK IF PLAYER WINS
     * CALLNEXTPLAYER, AND DISPLAY VALUE ON CLICKED CELL
     * EACH TIME A VALUE IS DISPLAYED IN A CELL BY ONE OF THE PLAYERS THE NEXT PLAYER IS TRIGGERED
     * DO THESE WHILE CELLS ARE STILL EMPTY
     * 
     * FUNCTION CALLNEXTPLAYER
     * PUSH TWO PLAYERS INTO AN ARRAY
     * IF ONE IS CALLED POP IT OFF THE ARRAY
     * IF ARRAY BECOMES EMPTY PUSH TWO PLAYERS BACK INTO THE ARRAY 
     * REPEAT;
     * 
     * FUNCTION REMOVEPLAYERFROMARRAY
     * THIS FUNCTION TAKES PLACE INSIDE THE CALL NEXT PLAYER FUNCTION
     * LOOP THROUGH THE ARRAY.LENGTH TO FIND THE FUNCTION AND THEN USE ARRAY.SPLICE OR DELETE TO TAKE IT OFF THE ARRAY 
     * 
     * FUNCTION CHECKWIN(ALGORITHM TO CHECK FOR MATCHES FOR WIN)
     * WHEN A VALUE IS ENTERED('X' OR 'O'), 
     * LOOP THROUGH TABLE DATA,RETURN INDEX OF ALL CELLS WHERE THAT VALUE EXISTS
     * LOOP THROUGH THOSE INDEXES AND CHECK IF THREE 'RE ON THE SAME LINE
     * IF THEY ARE, EDIT TEXT CONTENT BELOW PLAYER'S SECTION TO: YOU WON AND TO OTHER PLAYER: YOU LOST
     * RELOAD GAME;
     * ELSE JUST CALL NEXT PLAYER
     * IF MOVE COUNT = TOTAL NUMBER OF CELLS : GAME IS DRAWN
